        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pack dumpling wrappers round-shaped or homemade dumpling wrappers</li>
            <li>water for boiling</li>
            <li>oil for pan-frying</li>
            <li>Chinese black vinegar or Japanese ponzu, for dipping</li>
            <li>chili oil optional</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 cup water plus 1 teaspoon water</li>
            <li>extra all-purpose flour for dusting and rolling</li>
            <li>8 oz (230g) ground chicken thighs</li>
            <li>4 oz (230g) Napa cabbage finely sliced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ginger grated </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon scallion chopped</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
            <li>3 dashes ground white pepper</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>If you are making homemade dumpling wrappers, combine the all-purpose flour and water, and knead until the dough isnâ€™t sticky and the surface becomes smooth. Cover it with a damp cloth and rest for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Roll out the dough on a floured surface into a long cylinder. Cut the cylinders in half, and then cut each cylinder into 12 small pieces. Dust the rolling pin and roll each piece of the dough into a dumpling wrapper about 4 inches (10cm) in diameter. Set aside for the filling. You may use store-bought dumpling wrappers and skip this step.</li>
            <li>Prepare the filling by combining all the ingredients together. Use a spoon to mix well.</li>
            <li>To assemble the dumplings, place a piece of the wrapper on your palm and spoon 1 teaspoon of the filling onto the center of the wrapper. Do not overfill.</li>
            <li>Dip your index finger into a small bowl of water and moisten the outer edges of the wrapper. Fold the dumpling to form a half-moon shape. Press and seal tightly in the middle. Arrange the wrapped dumplings on a plate lined with parchment paper to avoid the dumplings from sticking to the bottom of the plate. Repeat the previous step until the filling is used up.</li>
            <li>Heat up a pot of water and bring it to a boil. Drop the dumplings gently into the water and boil for a few minutes until the dumplings float to the top. Use a strainer to scoop them out and transfer to a plate. Repeat until all dumplings are boiled.</li>
            <li>Heat up a skillet with some oil. Arrange about 8 dumplings on the skillet and pan-fry the dumplings until the bottom turns light brown, about 2 to 3 minutes. Turn it over and pan-fry the other sides of the dumplings. Add more oil and repeat the same process above until all dumplings become golden brown and crispy. Serve the dumplings warm with the dipping sauce.</li>

        </ol>
